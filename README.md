Code files for review

There are two scripts in this repo.

1. past_supplier_email_capture.py
    This is a django command to update the database entries in a column from 
    pre-existing values after parsing and extracting them from email. This is only for review and won't run without complete setup.
    
2. email_host_resolver.py
    This script is a completely working module. To identify email host given that email address in a csv file.
    The repo contains two directories, "input_csv" and "output_csv" with a sample csv file as seed.
